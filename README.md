This was one of my first projects and was a huge learning experience. Although it's a bit disorganized, it's a good demonstration of progress in my programming abilities when compared with later projects.

The project was to build a robot that could lead patrons in the library to their requested book. I was working with Dr. Gordon Carlson from the New Media Institute at Fort Hays State University around 2016. The robot was a Lego Mindstorms robot I installed an OS on that was capable of running python so we didn't have to use the Mindstorm drag-and-drop programming, and could focus on the software rather than building a robot from scratch.

The coolest part was it worked! I'm not sure if this repository actually has the final version of the program on it but I have pictures and videos of it running if you want to see.
